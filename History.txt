=== v0.1.3+ / not released yet -- available in the master branch on github
2008-09-11
* In local:restore_db, the db import would previously fail if the username was not specified in your database.yml
  file.  I have corrected this and set it to default to 'root' now (as rails does).

* Moved a lot of the information/instructions out of the README and onto the github wiki
  (http://github.com/jtrupiano/capistrano-extensions/wikis/home).
  
* Started hosting the gem at rubyforge.  You can now install directly from gem without downloading the source!

=== v0.1.3 / 2008-08-25
* 2008-08-25 : VERSION BUMP
  Introduced a new property :shared_content, which is intended to completely replace :content_directories
  eventually.  All directories previously specified by :content_directories go through a simple transformation
  to match the new hash construct that is :shared_content.  Now, we can specify non-public directories (though
  they are still limited to within RAILS_ROOT), e.g.
  
  set(:shared_content) { "feeds" => "content" }
  
  This will create a symlink whose source is #{shared_path}/feeds and whose target is RAILS_ROOT/content.
  Then, on successive deployments, this symlink is just recreated, and all of our feeds are still accessible
  (because they were stored outside of RAILS_ROOT and then symlinked in).

=== v0.1.2 / 2008-07-20
2008-08-20
*	Fixed a mysql bug that was encountered in "sync" operations.  When passing a password on the command-line
	(e.g. mysqldump -uuser -ppass), $'s in the password need to be escaped.  I also fixed the scenario where
	there was no password (common for restoring to the development environment).  Previously you would be
	prompted for a password only in the case where there was no password required.  This was a result of 
	the way the mysql commands were being built: "mysql -u#{user} -p#{password}" where password was nil or ""
