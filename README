== INCOMPLETE
* Missing a detailed sample config file
* Describe the shortcomings (or rather my dissatisfaction) with the remote syncing executables for
  assets/db.  It works fine for now, but is a little wasteful.
* Database synchronization _only_ works for MySQL. (not sure if I intend to change this any time soon)
* This has really only been tested on single-server deployments, so I'm not sure how well it will work
  on more complex environments -- I'll personally be able to test that in the coming month or two, but
  that will be dictated by necessity.
* Still no support for user-uploaded assets stored outside of the public/ directory
* Need to automate the generation of this document: the descriptions for each attribute/task
  should mirror the description in the deploy script (in other words, I should only have to update the
  the documentation in one place).

== DESCRIPTION/FEATURES

This gem provides a base set of Capistrano extensions including the following:
  * a new :gemfile RemoteDependency type
  * tasks/helpers for handling public asset folders (e.g. created by the file_column plugin)
  * tasks/helpers for auto-syncing server gems (via integration with Chad Wooley's GemInstaller gem)
  * helpers for dealing with multiple deployable environments (e.g. staging, prodtest, production)
  * tasks for working with remote logfiles
  * tasks for database/asset synchronization from production back to local environments

== CAPISTRANO CODE EXTENSIONS
* new RemoteDependency type :gemfile

  depend(:remote, :gemfile, "config/geminstaller.yml")

  Aliases the depend method (with depend_without_gemfile).  Proxies all calls with :type != :gemfile
  to the aliased method.  When :type == :gemfile, the gems file is parsed (using geminstaller 
  codebase) to iteratively call depend_without_gemfile with each gem found in the YAML file.

  This is still really only suitable for single-server deployments.  The idea would be to add new
  options to the geminstaller.yml config syntax that would allow us to reference specific
  capistrano roles for a given gem.  For instance, the database server won't need all of our rails
  gems.  A separate ferret server may require it's own set of gems, etc.

== NEW RECIPE PROPERTIES --> DEFAULTS
  # Provides a way to specify which uploadable asset directories (that live in public/)
  # should be retrievable via the local:copy_production_content and local:copy_production
  # tasks described below.  Note that this parameter is also utilized by the
  # passenger-recipes gem to keep these uploadable assets in the shared/ context.
  :content_directories --> []
  
  # This property is similar to :content_directories, except it doesn't assume that the symlinks
  # exist in the public/ directory (the default location for FileColumn file storage).
  #
  # This property is a hash of remote => local mappings, e.g.
  #
  #   "feeds" => "content" (or "uploaded_assets/meal" => "public/meal")
  #  
  # These examples will effectively create the following symlinks in a deployable environment:
  #   ln -sf \#{shared_path}/feeds RAILS_ROOT/content
  #   ln -sf \#{shared_path}/uploaded_assets/meal RAILS_ROOT/public/meal
  #  
  # Each key (the "remote" directory) must be a directory found in \#{shared_path} (in a deployable environment)  
  # Each value (the "local" directory) must be a directory found in RAILS_ROOT (in a local environment)
  :shared_content --> {}

  # Which environments are deployable-- for each environment specified in this array,
  # a helper function by the same name is created that is executed only if RAILS_ENV
  # is set to that value.  See examples/sample_deploy.rb for a code sample.
  :deployable_environments --> [:production]

  # We at SLS use a different config structure than rails does out of the box.
  # Setting this value to :sls will alter some of the expected paths.  Normally,
  # you will not have to set this variable.  To see a discussion of the SLS config
  # file structure, see http://blog.smartlogicsolutions.com/2008/06/02/better-setup-for-environments-in-rails/
  :config_structure --> :rails

== NEW RECIPES
* deploy:create_shared_file_column_dirs
  
  Creates shared filecolumn directories and symbolic links to them by 
  reading the :content_directories property.  Note that this task is not invoked by default,
  but rather is exposed to you as a helper.  To utilize, you'll want to override
  deploy:default and invoke this yourself.
  
* deploy:gem_update

  Invokes geminstaller to ensure that the proper gem set is installed on the target server.  
  Note that this task is not invoked by default, but rather is exposed to you as a helper.
  
* log:pull

  Tarballs deployable environment's rails logfile (identified by 
  RAILS_ENV environment variable, which defaults to 'production') and copies it to the local
  filesystem
  
* local:backup_db

  Backs up deployable environment's database (identified by the 
  RAILS_ENV environment variable, which defaults to 'production') and copies it to the local machine

* local:restore_db

  Untars the backup file downloaded from local:backup_db (specified via the FROM env 
  variable, which defalts to RAILS_ENV), and imports (via mysql command line tool) it back into the database 
  defined in the RAILS_ENV env variable.

  ToDo: implement proper rollback: currently, if the mysql import succeeds, but the rm fails,
  the database won't be rolled back.  Not sure this is even all that important or necessary, since
  it's a local database that doesn't demand integrity (in other words, you're still going to have to
  fix it, but it's not mission critical).

* local:backup_content

  Downloads a tarball of uploaded content (that lives in public/ directory, as specified by
  the :content_directories property) from the production site back to the local filesystem
  
* local:restore_content

  Restores the backed up content (evn var FROM specifies which environment was backed up, 
  defaults to RAILS_ENV) to the local development environment app

* local:sync_db

  Wrapper for local:backup_db and local:restore_db

  $> cap local:sync_db RAILS_ENV=production RESTORE_ENV=development
  
* local:sync_content

  Wrapper for local:backup_content and local:restore_content
  
  $> cap local:sync_content RAILS_ENV=production RESTORE_ENV=development
  
* local:sync

  Wrapper for local:sync_db and local:sync_content
  
  $> cap local:sync RAILS_ENV=production RESTORE_ENV=development

* remote:restore_db

  Uploads the backup file downloaded from local:backup_db (specified via the FROM env variable), 
  copies it to the remove environment specified by RAILS_ENV, and imports (via mysql command line 
  tool) it back into the remote database.

* remote:sync_db

  Backs up target deployable environment's database (identified by the FROM environment variable, 
  which defaults to 'production') and restores it to the remote database identified by the TO 
  environment variable, which defaults to "staging."  

  Because multiple capistrano configurations must be loaded, an external executable
  (capistrano-extensions-sync_db) is invoked, which independently calls capistrano.  See the 
  executable at $GEM_HOME/capistrano-extensions-0.1.2/bin/capistrano-extensions-sync_db

  $> cap remote:sync_db FROM=production TO=staging

* remote:restore_content

  Uploads the backup file downloaded from local:backup_content (specified via the FROM env variable), 
  copies it to the remote environment specified by RAILS_ENV, and unpacks it into the shared/ 
  directory.

* remote:sync_content

  Backs up target deployable environment's shared content (identified by the FROM environment 
  variable, which defaults to 'production') and restores it to the remote environment identified 
  by the TO envrionment variable, which defaults to "staging."  

  Because multiple capistrano configurations must be loaded, an external executable
  (capistrano-extensions-sync_content) is invoked, which independently calls capistrano.  See the 
  executable at $GEM_HOME/capistrano-extensions-0.1.2/bin/capistrano-extensions-sync_content

  $> cap remote:sync_content FROM=production TO=staging

* remote:sync

  Wrapper fro remote:sync_db and remote:sync_content.
  
  $> cap remote:sync FROM=production TO=staging
